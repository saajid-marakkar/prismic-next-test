                    I'm a photographer.  Feel free to call me 'Vish'. I've always been a follow your heart kind of a guy. When I decided to pursue photography,
                    I didn't exactly know where the journey would take me. But here I am living out this dream. I've been recognized by two awards while graduating in photography.
                    My forte is landscape and portraits because Iâ€™m inspired by light, music, travel and a bit vulnerability. When I'm not exploring the city, you can find me in
                    the beautiful Canadian wilderness. My work is personal, while it's a collection of moments and feelings. You'll find bits and pieces of my heart as well.
